  "I am Dr. Dinesh Kumar, Consultant Plastic & Cosmetic Surgeon, and my journey in plastic surgery has been driven by a simple belief — when people feel comfortable and confident in themselves, it can positively influence every aspect of their lives.",
  "I completed my MBBS, MS (General Surgery) and MCh (Plastic Surgery), followed by advanced fellowship training in cosmetic surgery, including training at Akademikliniken, Stockholm.",
  "What drew me towards cosmetic surgery was the unique combination of science, precision and artistry. Unlike many other areas of surgery, aesthetic surgery requires not only technical expertise, but also an understanding of proportion, symmetry and what makes an individual look naturally balanced.",
  "Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work with patients seeking both subtle enhancements and more significant changes. One thing I have learnt is that there is no universal definition of beauty. Every face and every body is different, and the same procedure can have very different goals for different people.",
  "That is why I believe the most important part of cosmetic treatment begins before the procedure itself — with listening. I take the time to understand what a patient is concerned about, what they hope to achieve and, equally importantly, what they may not need. I believe in giving honest advice, explaining realistic possibilities and discussing the benefits, limitations, risks and recovery associated with every treatment.",
  "Whether it is a subtle non-surgical enhancement or a carefully planned surgical procedure, my approach is centred around natural-looking results, personalised treatment and patient safety.",
  "For me, the most rewarding part of being a cosmetic surgeon is not simply seeing a change in appearance. It is seeing the change in confidence, comfort and the way a patient carries themselves afterwards. That is what continues to inspire me every day.",
